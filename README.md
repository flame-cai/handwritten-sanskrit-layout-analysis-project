# Towards text-line Segmentation from Sanskrit Manuscripts using Graph Neural Networks

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** November 12, 2025

### **Project Components**

*   **📁 Dataset:** 15 Sanskrit Manuscripts, 481 pages, with diverse layouts, annotated in graph based and PAGE-XML format
*   **⚙️ Synthetic Data Generator:** Scripts used to generate synthetic layout data in the graph based format
*   **💻 Source Code:** (Coming Soon)

## Dataset Overview

Each top-level folder represents a manuscript. Inside, the data is organized as follows:

#### 📁 `images/` 
Contains the original, high-resolution scanned images of manuscript pages.
*   `[PAGE_ID].jpg`: Original images are not provided with the dataset due to copyright reasons, however they can be accessed online at the URLs provided

#### 📁 `page-xml-graph-groundtruth/` 
Contains ground truth annotations in the form of bounding polygons.
*   `[PAGE_ID].xml`

#### 📁 `page-xml-rectangle/` 
Contains non-overlapping ground truth annotations in the form of bounding polygons.
*   `[PAGE_ID].xml`

#### 📁 `heatmaps/` 
Contains the output of CRAFT, which is a heatmap (with resolution downscaled by 2 maintaining aspect ratio)
*   `[PAGE_ID].jpg`

#### 📁 `gnn-dataset/` 
Contains pre-processed, model-ready data for training Graph Neural Networks.
*   `[PAGE_ID]_dims.txt`: Dimensions of heatmap (downscaled by 2 compared to the original image)
*   `[PAGE_ID]_inputs_normalized.txt`: Normalized node features for the GNN, maintaining aspect ratio (x,y,pseudo_fontsize). pseudo_fontsize is calculated based on the heatmap.
*   `[PAGE_ID]_inputs_unnormalized.txt`: Unnormalized node features (downscaled by 2 compared to the original image)
*   `[PAGE_ID]_labels_region.txt`: Ground truth labels for region classification. All points belonging to the same text-box share the same label
*   `[PAGE_ID]_labels_textline.txt`: Ground truth labels.  All points belonging to the same text-line share the same label

#### 📄 `index.csv`
This file acts as the master index for the entire dataset, providing metadata for each page.
*   `short_id`: A unique, zero-padded 6-digit identifier for each page entry.
*   `original_unique_id`: The primary file identifier (`[PAGE_ID]`) used across all subdirectories.
*   `dataset`: The name of the parent dataset collection (e.g., `sanskrit-manuscripts`).
*   `sub_manuscript_id`: The manuscript name a page belongs to (e.g., `ravisankrantivicharah`).
*   `layout`: A label indicating the complexity of the page layout (`simple` or `complex`).
